Popup Menu Example
===============================================================================

::

    This example demonstrates how to popup a menu.
    
    A menu can be popped up in 2-ways. The first is by declaring the menu as
    a child of a widget and setting the 'context_menu' attribute to True. The
    second method is by creating the menu on-demand, and then invoking it's
    'popup()' method to show the menu at the current mouse location.
