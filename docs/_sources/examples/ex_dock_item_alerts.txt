Dock Item Alerts Example
===============================================================================

::

    This example demonstrates the use of alerts on the DockItem widget.
    
    The DockItem widget and related bits in the DockArea support a style
    sheet pseudo-class named 'alert'. This pseudo-class is very powerful in
    that it allows the developer to provide their own arbitrary token to the
    pseudo-class as an argument, and then apply that token to a dock item at
    runtime. This gives the developer complete freed over the how they style
    their alerts, and does not force them in to a pre-defined hierarchy of
    alert levels.
