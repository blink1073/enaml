::

    An example of the `MenuBar` widget.
    
    This example demonstrates the use of the `MenuBar` widget. A `MenuBar`
    can have an arbitrary number of children, which must be `Menu` widgets.
    A `Menu` can have an arbitrary number of children which must be `Menu`
    widgets or `Action` widgets. An `Menu` child becomes a submenu, and an
    `Action` is represented as a clickable menu item. A `MenuBar` must be
    used as the child of a `MainWindow`.
    
    This example also demonstrates the `ActionGroup` widget. An `ActionGroup`
    is used logically group multiple `Action` widgets together. Changes to
    the `enabled` or `visible` state of the `ActionGroup` apply to all of the
    `Action` widgets in that group. Additionally, the `ActionGroup` is the
    primary means of making `Action` widgets exclusive. The default behavior
    of the group is to make all child `Action` widgets mutually exclusive.
    This can be disabled by setting `exclusive = False` on the `ActionGroup`.
