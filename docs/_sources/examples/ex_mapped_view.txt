Mapped View Example
===============================================================================

:download:`mapped_view <../../../examples/stdlib/mapped_view.enaml>`

::

    An example of using the Enaml stdlib `MappedView` component.
    
    The `MappedView` is an enamldef subtype of the `Include` type which will
    automatically create a view for an object based on it's type and a given
    typemap. See the documentation for `MappedView` for a full description.
    
    In this example, a simple class hierarchy is created. For each type in
    the hierararchy, a custom view is created. These views are provided as
    a typemap to a `MappedView` so that when a given object is selected, the
    proper view is displayed.
